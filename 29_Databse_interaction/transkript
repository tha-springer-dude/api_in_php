Now we have the basic framework of our API application set up, instead of outputting these placeholder messages

from the task controller,

we can manipulate some data in a database using the API.

In this section, we'll learn how to read and output data from the database.

First, we'll create a database.

I'll be doing this in the MariaDB database server that I have installed locally, which for all intents

and purposes is the same as MySQL.

All commands shown valid for either DBMS.

You'll have a similar setup if you installed the suggested software at the start of the course, although

feel free to use any relational database you like.

I'll be doing this on the command line, but if you prefer, you can use your GUI of choice, such as

phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench.

Let's start by connecting to the database server on the command line using the root account.

Then we'll create a new database, which I'll just call "api_db". Then we'll create a user just for accessing

this database, so we don't have to do it using the root account.

This user will have full privileges on all the tables in the new database.

I'll call the user "api_db_user",

it's on the localhost server and we'll assign a random password.

You need to make a note of this password for when we connect to the database later on

from PHP.

To check this works, we can exit from the console,

and reconnect using the user and password

we just created.

Then we can select the database with use, and that selects it with no problems.
