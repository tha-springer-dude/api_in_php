In addition to the request headers, the response also includes headers which represent metadata about

the response.

Common response headers include details about the response body, like its length, the language it uses

and the type, for example, HTML, JSON and so on.

To view all the response headers, we set the CURLOPT_HEADER setting to true.

Now, when we make a request, the response headers are included as part of the response body, before

the payload, with a blank line separating them. With this response,

we can see some standard headers, like the response type, which in this case is JSON, and the content

length, which is the size of the response body below in bytes.

There are also some non-standard headers, which typically begin with an X, for example, with this

API,

this account is limited to 50 requests per hour, which is shown in the x-ratelimit header,

and it also reports how many are left in the remaining header. Adding this option to the cURL request

does include all the headers as part of the response body.

There are a few response header values that can be retrieved individually using the curl_getinfo

function,

for example, the content type and its length.

We're already using this function to get the status code.

So let's do the same for the content type, passing in the relevant constant,

and also the content length.

Then, let's print these out in the same way.

Now when we run this,

we get the content type and the content length.

As with the request headers, details of what data are included in the response headers will be

covered in the API's documentation.
