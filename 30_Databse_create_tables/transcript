Now we can add a table to the database to store task data.

Let's create a table called "task" with the following fields: an ID field

that's an integer,

it can't be null, and will set this to auto increment to assign values automatically.

Then a name field, which is a 128 character varchar, that can't be null.

Next, a field called priority, which is an integer, and this can be null, with null as the default

value.

Finally, a field called is_completed, which is a boolean, can't be null and is false by default.

We'll make the ID column the primary key,

and add a non-unique index to the name column.

I've included columns of various different types so that we can see how these are encoded into JSON

format later on.

Let's have a look at the table we just created,

and there it is.

Let's view the indexes,

and there they are.

As mentioned before, you can do this using a GUI like phpMyAdmin if you prefer.
