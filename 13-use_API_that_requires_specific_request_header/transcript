Before we learn about the request method, we need to see how to use the GitHub API as we'll be using

this to demonstrate how request methods work.

We'll be using the part of the API that lets you start a repository, which, if you're unfamiliar,

is like bookmarking repositories.

As with the Unsplash API, the GitHub API requires an access token, which you can generate in the Personal

Access Token section of the developer settings in your GitHub account.

Before we start with the GitHub API, to keep it simple, let's just remove the response header code

that we added earlier.

Then let's change the authorization header to the format required by the GitHub API, followed by your

own token value as.

We'll start by using the API to check if a repository is starred or not, which we do by sending a Get

request to this endpoint.

Substituting the owner and repo name you want to check.

You can check any repository you like.

For this example, I'll use the http repo, which just happens to be a tool we'll be using later on

in the course us.

Right?

So let's change the URL to this endpoint, passing in the repo owner and repo name as part of the URL.

Right.

Let's give that a try.

And we get an error message with a 403 status code request forbidden us.

This is because the GitHub API requires all requests to include a valid user agent header, which can

be your GitHub username or the name of your application.

For example,

There are two ways you can add this header.

One is to use the array of headers we're already using for the authorization token.

So let's add that and I'll set it to my GitHub username a3.

Now when we run this we get a 204 status code.

This corresponds to the repository being starred by my user, which as we can see it is A3.

The other way to add this header is with the user agent option.

And when we run this it works in the same way.

So in addition to the authorization token, the GitHub API requires a user agent header which you can

add using either of these methods, whichever you prefer.
