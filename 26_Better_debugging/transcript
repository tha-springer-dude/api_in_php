You need to set this to the string "on".

If you don't have access to the configuration file to change this setting, you can do it in code with

ini_set function, setting display_errors to "on".

If we look at the error message, we can see the error is occurring because the second argument to the

processRequest method is expected to be a string, but null was given.

If there's no ID in the URL, the ID variable is set to null.

We can mark the type declaration on the ID argument as a nullable by prefixing it with a question

mark.

Now when we make the request, the error has gone and it works as expected.

If we try it with an ID, this also still works.

With type declarations and strict type checking enabled, finding bugs will be easier and the code will

be more readable.
